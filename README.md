# The Heartwater Demo

## Background and Vision

Michael & Ylianna (M&Y) Didashi approached Sky Springs to package water for their Heart Water brand that they plan on launching. Michael has an [inspiring background](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dadashi) and he and his wife believe in giving back to society. With Heart Water, they plan on selling bottled water that funds charitable causes.

M&Y planned on wiriting their message of giving on every bottle that they sold. Reed and Narayan met with M&Y and introduced the concept of a unique QR code on each package. This QR code would use the iPhone/Android native Camera apps in order to launch a unique static web page to:

1. Provide ingredients and production data about the bottle
2. Provide details about the charity that that bottle purchase funded
3. Allow users to contribute additional funds to the cause
4. Sign up to follow the project story to conclusion

This repo is the static website that will be launched when the user scans the QR code.
